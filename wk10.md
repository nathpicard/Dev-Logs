# Trying to put together a project #
**1. Adding final text**
- Finish typing of Restaurant info
- Finish typing up laundry info

**2. Adding photos??**
- newspaper clippings mostly
- don't use the photos from the *Lives of the Families* website because they are not mine to use
- go to the ottawa archives and make the videos better!! & photos better!

**3. Making vidoes!!!**
- In the video description, explain how the video is attempting to get an impression of what Ottawa's chinatown was like. There aren't very many images available, so I had to use images that weren't historically accurate, but where authentic to the atmosphere that I have gleaned from my research.
- Videos start out with a big shot of a bus arriving to that one block on Albert Street, and break up in to various different stories about the businesses and how they're conducted
- Try and mimic the 1920s style of cutting between lots of busy people, black and white expose... but also be wary of making the film look comical or exagerated or stereotypical. walk the fine line.

**4. About the Project tab**
- *paradata:*  Include it after the basic details of the project are outlined, include screenshots?
- Use the paradata to start a conversation about the authority, insider/outsider and who the history is for
- am I the right person to be telling this history?

**5. About me page**
- use a photo?
- be personal?

**6. Sidebar**
- I wanted to be able to navigate between the different main content pages within their sites, so I made a side bar that connects them all. I managed to link through the images that I uploaded, and the video tab isn't completely uniform with the others, but I'm pretty satisfied with how the sidebar looks. It achieves what I want it to.

## The video ##

This is mostly what I focused on this week- Made rough shells of the vidoes that will be the final product. They range from 45 seconds to 1 minute, and I think I might cut them all down to the shorter time frame, to give the impression that time is flying by and these are whisps of memories. I am in serious need of more photos that I can use legally, so I'm going to dive back into newspapers.com and go to the Ottawa City Library to see if I can dig up anything now that I have an even better idea of what I'm doing. I will have to come back to the website of course, and then go back to video making. I'm trying to balance working between the two so that I can ultimately produce two pieces that truly feel like they fit together.
