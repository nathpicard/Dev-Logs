# Trying to put together a website #
**1. Adding final text**
- Finish typing of Restaurant info
- Finish typing up laundry info

**2. Adding photos??**
- newspaper clippings mostly
- don't use the photos from the *Lives of the Families* website because they are not mine to use
- go to the ottawa archives and make the videos better!! & photos better!

**3. Making vidoes!!!**
- In the video description, explain how the video is attempting to get an impression of what Ottawa's chinatown was like. There aren't very many images available, so I had to use images that weren't historically accurate, but where authentic to the atmosphere that I have gleaned from my research.
- Videos start out with a big shot of a bus arriving to that one block on Albert Street, and break up in to various different stories about the businesses and how they're conducted
- Try and mimic the 1920s style of cutting between lots of busy people, black and white expose... but also be wary of making the film look comical or exagerated or stereotypical. walk the fine line.

**4. About the Project tab**
- *paradata:*  Include it after the basic details of the project are outlined, include screenshots?
- Use the paradata to start a conversation about the authority, insider/outsider and who the history is for
- am I the right person to be telling this history?

**5. About me page**
- use a photo?
- be personal?
