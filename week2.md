# Devlog2

_things to know about me_

-I like to be structured.

-I like to feel like I'm working towards a purpose.

-I am going to try my best to make those things happen in this class; where structure is not the main priority.

-As such, I'm thinking of writing my devlogs this way for the next weeks. Each week, I will produce a devlog that's separated into these categories to track my thoughts on the the class and how it will eventually relate to my own project.

## Attempts 2 Code ##
**Command Line**

-black background, green writing: I feel like I'm in the Matrix 

-It's cool, but I have a very set way of organizing my stuff, and changing that would be annoying.

## thoughts on the readings ##
Augmented realities got me thinking about my own MRP. I want to create a physical resource for teaching Japanese Internment in classrooms, but producing such a thing would be extremely costly. Perhaps augmented reality is a way of circumventing this? Students could feel like objccts on a paper are actually 3D.

Together, the readings got me thinking about how necessary a strong understanding of the past is for the creation of a better future- just like Bethany Nowviski discussed in regards to Afro-Futurism. What's exciting is being able to see how the digital incorporation in history makes it cyclical in nature.   

## thoughts in class ##
-looked at projector mapping and library boxes

-we are automatically replicating baggage --> unless we make an effort to actively work against reproducing the dominant narrative.

**library boxes discussion** 

-It's securre, document drop : libertarian fantasies

-beat the digital divide, audio walks, 

-re-writing the purpose of the space

_The negatives_

-Money to develop tools, but not checking what doesn't work. When things don't work we don't tell people because it looks bad frankly....

-Who can trust the box?

-how data is arranged; without considering the non-dominant groups, they can open up vs close down who can access the interfaces

-how to persuade people to connect: attach authority, physical location, community 

-we are automatically replicating baggage:

## concluding thoughts ##
-Sometimes I wonder if this is actually a history class. I can understand how activism now is tied to history, and how we must consider history when making these projects so we aren't simply re

-I love that we're already thinking in terms of projects, and relating this to the real world.

-I am so excited at the idea of projection mapping in Chinatown. To me it feels less like a way to reach out to a community and an action that can bring people together to celebrate a hidden aspect of their history than a "Guerilla" act. I don't feel like Guerilla History is really my jam?
