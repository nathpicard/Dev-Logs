## How has this tech been used in Ottawa ##

Traditionally, it’s been used by government and other people in power to make public displays that further the dominant narrative about the country.
According to the gov website, 1984 was the first sound and light show. With updates in technologies as the years progressed in 2010 Mosaika debuted, using the projection mapping technology for the first time.

According to surveys :
	•	95 percent were very or extremely satisfied with the show.
	•	90 percent would watch the show again.
	•	99 percent would recommend it to others.
	•	92 percent said that it helped them appreciate the beauty of Parliament Hill, the Capital, and Canada.

Trip advisor accolades include : “brilliant” , wonderful!” And “very cool” 
and “Mosaika distorts Canadian History. As a history teacher, I was appalled”

Example of a projection mapping which was Ottawa based:

Business Journal : “glittering achievement for Ottawa 2017 team”
the first exhibit of its kind in a metro station that’s still under construction
“Now I realize why we are the only city in the world that has ever done this. “
About 16,000people first full weekend
enjoyable and emotional experience that stimulates the senses, while highlighting Ottawa’s innovative, techy side and getting people excited about the LRT opening in 2018. 

These events all had newspapers and other forms of media promoting them encouraging a large and exciting turnout. 

The public support has been pretty overwhelming- critics are few and far between. And it tends to only be that it’s over hyped.

Smaller art projects:
STARDUST is Chowaniec Projects' first interactive installation.
As a part of Project SPACE & Wall Space Framing, Train Yards
“The STARDUST installation is an interactive and educational experience in an alternative gallery space, a sanctuary in which you can be alone with your thoughts”

## How could it be used? ##
-In tandem with location based website, I could use projection mapping to shine light on the forgotten history of Ottawa’s original Chinatown  (between Kent and O’Connor, 2 blocks along Albert street). 
-I like it because it’s temporary, but public in that its accessible to anyone who is walking by.

## How does it resonate with the story that I want to tell? ##
-Projection mapping can be a physical window into the past- which is the goal of this project; to provide people a glimpse of an Ottawa that once was, and one that might subvert their idea of Ottawa’s history (in suggesting the long history of a Chinese community in Ottawa, that your average Canadian may not necessarily be aware of)
-I like the idea that it’s impermanent as well, because it reflects the very businesses whose stories I am looking to share. Whose lots on Albert Street were torn down and they moved towards Somerset or different cities entirely.

## Problematic? concerns? ##
-something emphasized in many articles is how expensive each of these shows are. Especially the large projects of Mosaika, Northern Lights and Kontinuum have massive budgets and the support from media/popular support.  Will have to find a way to work around the budgetary constraints

## What do I need to do? ##
-I need to find photographs of at least one of the businesses that can be used to project onto the wall, I know there is information in the Ottawa City Directory of 1931 about the different businesses, but whether photographic evidence exists will take more effort, as well as establishing exactly where the businesses were physically located. I plan on reaching out to the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Center, because they conducted a history project in 2013 that could have some useful photos and information about the families who owned the businesses.

-I want to reach out to the local Ottawa Chinese Canadian Association and ask them for their support of the project- because it is their history that I want to tell. I do not feel comfortable doing a project like this without their consent.
