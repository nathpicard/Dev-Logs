## Into the Archives: What I've Found So Far ##
**The Newspaper Archive**

I've found a ton of newspaper articles related to chinese owned laundromats and restaurants in Ottawa during the first half of the 20th century. The articles are interesting, but not exactly related to the list of businesses that I'm looking to write about. 

_Here's a sample of some of the images that I've found:_

**The Ottawa Archive**

I received a reply from them telling me that they were unable to find any documents relating to the addresses, business names or family names that I provided them. However, at the City Archives in Napean, they have a Reference Library which contains secondary sources on businesses in Ottawa.

The City of Ottawa Library also has archives with some paraphenalia related to businesses, particularly a painting and menu from the Canton Restaurant that was a staple along Albert Street from the 1930s up until the 1980s- I have also found ads for this restaurant, as well as an obituary for the owner. It seems to me that Canton is the business with the most media surrounding it, and while it was an important business to the neighbourhood, I see the whole concept of my project as raising awareness for the entire community that centered around that area. I don't want to base my website on just one business.

I haven't had the time to go to Napean to check out this research room yet.

**Reaching Out to the Community**

I've sent an email to the Programs Coordinator for the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Center (OCCSC), and hope to receive a reply shortly. In the *Lives of the Family* book Denise Chong used many family photos that aren't in the archive, because they are private photos with the families still. In reaching out to the OCCSC I'm hoping that I might be able to connect with those families, or gain access to some of those photos for my website through communication with the OCCSC.

If I fail to gain access to those photos, I'll have to rely more heavily on secondary sources, and stories sourced from previous, publicly available interviews. I will have to branch out my original plan for projection mapping to share photos and video clips that are relevant to Chinese Canadians in Ottawa, and historically accurate, but not actual clips from the physical time and place that I'm centering this project on.

**How I'm feeling about research**

It's frustrating to be looking for very specific information. I don't want to broaden my scope, but at the same time I'm not going to limit myself to just a few photos or newspaper clips in making this website and projection piece. If my plans to find the perfect sources fail, I will have to branch out my original plan for projection mapping and complimentary website. I will  share photos and video clips that are relevant to Chinese Canadians in Ottawa, and historically authentic, but not actual clips from the physical time and place that I'm centering this project on. 

Still... fingers crossed that the OCCSC will get back to me in a timely manner with some good news!

## The Digital: Brainstorming the Specifics ##
**Projection Mapping**

My original concept was to map photos onto a wall to look like the businesses were standing there, in their original locations- the projection becoming a literal window into the past. Now... I'm not sure how feasible of a plan that is.

I'm currently mulling over the idea of havinga 1 minute video on loop that uses photos of the street, businesses and families that were set up there, along with supplementary media such as newspaper cllippings (and maybe political clips such as related to the Head Tax that was imposed on Chinese throughout this period) and tell a more general story of what the people who lived on this street would have experienced. The video would try to capture the culture of the Albert Street Chinatown. This window would be different... more like a look into the past, rather than a physical presence of the past right on the street. 

I think the clip could start with the front face of a business, so I would only need one photo like that, and then would enter into it and explore the complex lives of those Chinese Canadians who set up shop in Ottawa a century ago.

I want the clip to be 1 minute long, but so that people could stop and watch it twice or three times, and each time glean a little bit more into the multitude of stories for the families who were established in this neighbourhood.

**The Website**

This is what I've been trying to work on over the break, while I'm waiting to hear back from sources, and mulling over how I can project a complex and interesting story onto a downtown building in 1 minute.

_What I've done_
- Found a map of Ottawa for the background of the website.
- Research on the different businesses to narrow down which I would like to highlight on the map
- Started collecting secondary information about each business that will be accessible through clicking on pins on said map.
- Started writing drafts for the extra information pages for each pin

_Problems I'm already facing..._
- How do I make the backgroun map not tiled, and how can I place pins for different locations onto that map?
- Will I end up choosing the businesses with the most media, and therefore the most well known businesses
- The workers history museum just published a freaking comic about the Lee Kung Grocery owning family, the Wongs! I'm doing something that's being done by other people! Nooooooooo

## The Historiosity of it all ##
I'm not feeling too good about the history. I feel a little bit like I'm lying about the history. There's a tension between not having the materials to tell a compelling history, and using materials that aren't directly related but making the type of projection and website that could draw people in. I'm still trying to decide where I want to stand in my own presentation, but in order to have a final product for this class, I'm currently leaning towards the authenticity but not actually accurate photos.
