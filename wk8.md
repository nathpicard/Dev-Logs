# Yikes #

**Full disclosure:** I'm writing my week 8 devlog on what is now Week 10.

*How did I fall so far behind?* 

Well, for a couple reasons-

1. An unexpected project relating to my thesis and helping an old supervisor has taken up all of my mind space.

2. Presenting at Underhill has taken up the rest of my mind space.

3. The strike has temporarily forestalled my ability to access the Media Commons room, thus keeping me from working on the projection mapping aspect of my project

4. I've done a terrible job of putting aside time for working on this project, and planning my life in general.

...Mostly number 4.

At any rate, I will now outline my plan to get back on track.

1. Dedicate a couple full days of work this week strictly to this project.

2. Write bi-weekly devlogs to track this increase in productivity.

3. *Get _shit_ done.*

I'd also like to acknowledge that initially I was excited for this system of weekly tracking of progress in the hopes that it would keep me to task, since I often have the habit of doing most of my project/essay work last minute. I now realize that the system mostly serves to remind me of how terribly I am at keeping to task, and to highlight the degree to which I am use to leaving my work to the last minute. I should improve on this.

# Intense Research Montage #
 I've realized that because of the time frame and my inability to reach out successfully to the Chinese Community Association, I'm going to be relying on secondary sources for much of my historic community mapping website, and the projection mapping display that I want to present. I want to find appropriate images for my project.

 ## Thoughts ##
 I'm feeling very uncertain as I do all of this resesarch. I've been reaching out without success to members of the chinese community, and it feels strange to be an outsider trying to tell this history. If I were writing an essay to submit for this class, I know I wouldn't be having these feelings. Part of me feels like I'm putting knowledge into the public that is already there. I try to tell myself that I'm sharing it in a new way, that seeks to reach a new audience and peak interest in those who may be unfamiliar with this aspect of Ottawa's history- but then I come across difficulties of finding photos, and when I do find them, they're being contributed to websites by the descendents of these business owners who are still living in Ottawa. Again, I have doubts about whether I should be doing this project in the first place.... but I'm too far in now, and I have a grade on the line, so I feel like I have to do it and do it well. I'm not doing it well right now. I don't know how I'm going to find enough images to make an intersting montage. I don't know how I'm going to tell a story that differs from the very well done Lives of the Family website and that doesn't feel like I'm stealing from them. I don't know what my role as a digital historian or public historian is in this scenario that I find myself in. 
 
 I'm going to come back to this work tomorrow, and maybe I'll have a clearer sense of the purpose of this project. But I'm currently feeling like a copy-cat and outsider. Hopefully, I'll find a way to change that.
