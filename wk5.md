## Let the Research Begin... ##
-I spent Monday afternoon at the Ottawa Library going through the city directories. I went through 4 city directors separated by decades. I started at 1931-2, which was listed in the bibliography of a short Chapter on Ottawa's Chinatown in David Chuenyan Lai's book *Chinatowns: Towns within Cities in Canada*. From there, I skipped a decade for 30 years in succession to 1961. What I found was promising! There are a number of chinese establishments in the Old Chinatown that were evidently pillars of the neighbourhood. A restaurant, an inn, a grocery, the Ottawa Oriental Club, a couple laundromats. These businesses all remained steadfast on that street over decades. 

Now that I have my eye on a couple businesses, I was told that the City of Ottawa archives is the place to go to for photos. I'll see what are the best quality photos that I can find. Since my current conception of this projection mapping project is only going to focus on one business to project onto a building wall, I just need one great quality photo to use. However, I also want to fill a website with a more detailed story about the lives of the residents of that original chinatown. I'll try and collect a bunch of relevant photos for the wesbite, and documents related to the businesses if possible.

The thing that I'm worried about right now is reaching out to the Chinese community in Ottawa and seeing if they can help me, especially if there are any descendents of the owners of those businesses who I can talk to. It's scary to reach out to a group who you don't belong to but want to tell their story. It comes back to this idea of insider and outsider that we talked about in Public History last semester. This concept of asking permission pushes against some of the topics that we've discussed in class this semester, but I would feel deeply uncomfortable making this project without discussing with the community to whom the stories belong.

## Other Digital Projects ##
-I think I figured ARis out? At least... if I put all of the conversations and pins in one city, then you can view them all for the game. I have one week before valentines day, so I need to make sure it's playable on an Android phone before then. The one thing that I won't be able to control is whether the location tracking will work- so that conversations can only be opened in certain areas.
