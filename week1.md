# Welcome to my DevLog

My name is Nathalie Picard. I've just enrolled in a Digital History course, and I've used a computer for multiple hours everyday of my (young)adult life...yet this is all shamefully new to me.

## what did we cover in class? ##

-it seems like there is an element of entitlement in this course? That we can do anything? But we have access to this stuff?

â€”>you need the stakeholders to want to be involved how would it work otherwise

-how this course is gonna work:
	-projection mapping
	-pirateboxes
	-locative storytelling
  
  *Question I should ask myself:*
  
      should I finally get twitter?


Sketches where you can use your phone to see the object as a 3D model

**core concepts:**
-deformation + performance

-Future proofing

-write in trext files

-Digital tech requires submission - it's necessary to push back

-Hidden from whom?

-Location based game/story that is triggered by space

-3d models: photogrammetry

## concluding thoughts ##

**What do I hope to get out of this course?**

I want to be less intimidated by internet, and feel more comfortable interacting with the digital humanities. To be honest, it would be so cool if I could learn how to code. It seems really difficult though.

**What are the numbers on the side of this <>Edit file?**

Seriously... do they mean anything?

**Thoughts about the course**

I'm terrified.

I'm excited.
