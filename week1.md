# hello-world

My name is Nathalie Picard. I've just enrolled in a Digital History course, and I've used a computer for multiple hours everyday of my (young)adult life...yet this is all shamefully new to me. 

**What do I hope to get out of this course?**

I want to be less intimidated by internet, and feel more comfortable interacting with the digital humanities. To be honest, it would be so cool if I could learn how to code. It seems really difficult though.

**What are the numbers on the side of this <>Edit file?**

Seriously... do they mean anything?

**Thoughts about the course**

I'm terrified.
