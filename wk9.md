**mod no.1** rights and permissions

I've sent emails to and called various members of the Chinese Canadian Association and Chinese Service Centre, without any responses.

When I called, people seemed unfamiliar with the online projects that I was referring to. Yet, there are photos accesible online that I want to use for both my website and my mapping project. How can I use these without violating the rights of the families who donated these photos in the first place.

I don't publish the website, and I don't show the presentation publicly. In many ways, I'm admitting failure by even proposing this. The whole point of creating a Digital intervention, a guerilla digital history, is the disruption itself. Without making my project public, it will be unable to intervene within the public sphere.

However, I think the rights of the community are more valuable to my project than my ability to "disrupt". In focussing my project too early, and not fully considering the difficulties that I was going to face in finding the media necessary to produce this project, I failed. In retrospect, maybe I should have abandoned this project earlier. I should have tried to tell a different history. Yet, I stubbornly persevered, and must now do what I can to produce this class project while also respecting the community.



**mod no.2** CUPE's strike and access to the media lab

Expecting the strike to take less time than it has, my plan was to wait until the strike was over to use the media commons for the creation of my projection mapping movies. This is no longer feasible. Therefore, I will download a more modest video editing software to produce the short films that I plan on using as the *projection mapping* portion of my project. I'm sure that this will result in a perfectly acceptable video, however I will have fewer tools to make the videos. I will likely focus on using features such as the Burns Effect to draw the eye and create stories, which is something available on all platforms.

## problem solving ##

These are largely digital problems that I need to overcome this week. I have all of the content, but I need to put the content on the website and have it be in the right place in relation to the map that I have uploaded

**prob no 1.** 

Map size

The map I've uploaded to my website, but it's in a tile format. I need to figure out how to make it a larger size. Currently, fiddling with MapWarper in the hopes that I will figure it out.



**prob no.2** 

Making my pins fit the right locations on the map

I have the locations of 6 different businesses that I want to pin on the map, all of which can be found along Albert Street between O'Connor and Bank streets. This will emphasize the density and proximity of the Old Ottawa Chinatown.

1. 201 Albert Street - Lang Yick Grocery

2. 203 Albert Street- Chinese Amusement Club

3. 205 Albert Street- Canton Inn

4. 211 Albert Street- Oriental Club of Ottawa

5. 247 Albert Street- On Hong Chinese Laundry

6. 249 Albert Street- Hamilton's Cafe


From these 6 businesses, I have further information written up about 4 of them: Lang Yick, the Oriental Club, the Canton Inn and On Hong Chinese Laundry. I chose them to represent the four videos that I will be making, for each type of business that were associated with early chinese families in Ottawa; the grocery, the restaurant and the laundry. The presence of social clubs is also significant within any established Chinese community, and thus I felt it was important to include that as well. For some businesses I have more information than for others. As I couldn't find as much personal information about certain owners and their families, I also include more general information about how those types of businesses played a role in the early Ottawa Chinese Canadian community.

## What now? ##
With one week left, it's about putting everything together. I need to make sure that the website loads, and that all the pins fall on the right place on the old map of Ottawa that I have found. I need to take all of the photos and clips that I've collected, write some captions and edit them together into 4 looping videos.

It's a matter of putting in the time to pull off this project.
