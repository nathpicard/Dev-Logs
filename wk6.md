## Valentines Day Aris Scavenger Hunt ##
For Valentines day I made an Aris Scavenger Hunt for my boyfriend, who lives in Chicago. After working on it for about a week, and checking it on my iphone with the location services off, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed pretty quickly once Valentines Day came around.

**Here were the problems:**

1. He uses an android phone. So I had him download the app using a github link. There were no problems...with the download.

2. The app crashed multiple times. Every time that he tried to load the game, it would last a couple minutes before crashing again. It was very frustrating.

3. His phone did not have accurate location identification, and could not use the location services to pick up items within the space that was available.

4.I created items that the players could pick up during conversations in various areas of the city. I had made the mistake of making "Hugs" a maximum of -6, rather than a maximum of 6. So, he was unable to pick it up, and I spent a good 10 minutes of problem solving before realizing I had made a typo.

5. He was busy, and didn't have the chance to go to the various places that I had chosen as scavenger hunt locations, because they weren't convenient for his day.

**How I dealt with them:**

1. poorly

2. I played tech support a lot of the time. I changed the items that were necessary to unlock different gifts- for example the fake advertisement video that I'd edited. However, once he collected the items necessary for this gift, the video itself didn't load. I hadn't clicked "preload media" as an option on the settings page, so perhaps this would have solved the problem. However, due to my own impatience and time constraint, I just sent him the video over google drive, so I could see his reaction ot it.

3. He was willing to try things twice or three times to try and get the game to work. Obviously, he was invested in the game working since I had made it for him, which mean that the next day he went out to the farther locations to try and collect items. He was also willing to reload the app as I made slight changes to it in order to assure that he could collect items and unlock gifts properly.

Overall, a frustrating experience. However, I have a better grasp of how to put together a digial world that is invisible to us without the use of our phones. I think it further contributes to my ideas about online being simply another location or dimension that is no less real than the physical one in which we exist. I also feel much more competent about using the ARIS software, and am considering giving the game another go, but for a friend living in Japan.
