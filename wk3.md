# Attempts 2 code #

## Thoughts on readings ##

-Surprisingly short chapters. I'm much more drawn to the concept of Poetic Terrorism than Art Sabotage. I think this stems from a constant interest in creating and making over destroying. I think that I understand the desire to destroy in order to resist the reproduction of past values.

-Both pieces discuss *aesthetic shock*, which I interpret to be

  1. the shock that is a result of seeing a unexpected visual
  2. it's beautifully shocking

- I like the idea of aesthetic as beautiful, or poetic as beautiful... but I also understand that my conception of beauty has been shaped by the world surrounding me. So maybe I do need to destroy in order to re-write what my idea of aesthetic beauty.
