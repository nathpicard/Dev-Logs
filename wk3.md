## Thoughts on readings ##
-Surprisingly short chapters. I'm much more drawn to the concept of Poetic Terrorism than Art Sabotage. I think this stems from a constant interest in creating and making over destroying. I think that I understand the desire to destroy in order to resist the reproduction of past values.

-Both pieces discuss *aesthetic shock*, which I interpret to be

  1. the shock that is a result of seeing a unexpected visuals
  2. it's beautifully shocking

-I like the idea of aesthetic as beautiful, or poetic as beautiful... but I also understand that my conception of beauty has been shaped by the world surrounding me. So maybe I do need to destroy in order to re-write my idea of aesthetic beauty.

## Thoughts in class ##
-We are going to be making an Aris game... not sure how that's going to go. 

-in Public history we think on a broadcast model- we aren't thinking about individuals. Should we be trying to access them as individuals?

-anonymity; remove semblance of authority from who is making the

-the attack on truth through the digital; we need ways to identify the truth and who is trustworthy despite all of these bots and others factors distracting us.

-Where do i draw the line, what does it mean for me as a historian. What is my line?

-by staying in the academic sphere, we save ourselves from being criticized or being attacked for our opinions.

## Concluding Thoughts ##

-I left class for an hour because I was feeling ill- apologies.

-Aris is difficult, but I felt like I had managed to make a dent in understanding the software. It occurs to me that for a lot of these technologies the learning curve is quite steep. You have to learn quite a bit initially to get your foot in the door, but each thing that you learn is a stepping stone to reach the next level of difficulty. Hopefully this compounding of learning will help us in our projects in the coming weeks.
