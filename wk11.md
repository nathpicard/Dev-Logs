# Website developments #
Surprisingly, I managed to make a side bar for my website info pages so that you can navigate between them when reading about the various aspects of life on Albert Street.

I have also finished typing up the information (finally) and am incredibly relieved to have that out of the way.

I am at the city of Ottawa archives today looking for some final photos to use on the website and in the video. This is by far the biggest challenge that I have faced making this website and projection mapping project, but I hope that I will be able to successfully find images today and then I will truly be on the final stages of this project.

## left to do: ##
1. Images for the social club webpage (april 3)
2. Images for the groceries webpage (april 3)
3. About me write-up (april 4)
4. About the Project part 1. What is this project (april 5)
5. Abour the Project part 2. the para-data and being transparent (april ?? **this is the final step despite it being #5**)
6. Edit and export videos for all four content (april 4)
7. Decide how to upload videos (youtube?) to embed them on my website (april 4)
8. It's done????!!
