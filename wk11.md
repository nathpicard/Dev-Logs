# Website developments #
Surprisingly, I managed to make a side bar for my website info pages so that you can navigate between them when reading about the various aspects of life on Albert Street.

I have also finished typing up the information (finally) and am incredibly relieved to have that out of the way.

I am at the city of Ottawa archives today looking for some final photos to use on the website and in the video. This is by far the biggest challenge that I have faced making this website and projection mapping project, but I hope that I will be able to successfully find images today and then I will truly be on the final stages of this project.

## left to do: ##
1. /Images for the social club webpage (april 3)
2. /Images for the groceries webpage (april 3)
3. /About me write-up (april 4)
4. About the Project part 1. What is this project (april 5)(april 5)
5. Abour the Project part 2. the para-data and being transparent (april ?? **this is the final step despite it being #5**)
6. /Edit and export videos for all four content (april 4) *bonus: try it out on map map and it works???*
7. Decide how to upload videos (youtube?) to embed them on my website (april 4)(april 5)
8. It's done????!! 

## April 4/update ##
Today I edited all the videos together as 40s clips. Individually I don't think the clips are particularly strong, but I think that all the videos put together pack a punch. I may ask Shawn to bring his projector to Mike's Place tomorrow so I can do my guerilla intervention and projection map in there!

I did not get the chance to figure out how exactly I want to present the videos on the website. I have a screen recording of all 4 videos playing at once, but if I could record it being projected somewhere and upload that to the website, I think that would be the ideal solution. I will work on that tomorrow, as well as the about the project page. 

Paradata is the last step, as noted above. I'm still not entirely sure how I want to format that for ultimate transparancy, but also to maintain a level of professionalism to the website. Even with the "about the maker" page, I feel that admitting that the site is only a launching point and that I'm by no means an expert in the field, it makes the site less legitimate. It's a strange feeling, because I would not feel this way if I were writing an essay.
