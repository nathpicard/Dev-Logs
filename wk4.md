## Oral Presentation: feedback & revisions ##
-reach out to Denise Chong (Calgary) and the OCCSC

-film my project. This will make the impermanent slightly permanent, and will also make it an archive which I can show as a part of my "historical repertoire".

-Go to the archives and just find the information necessary. I need to have history to share, before I can focus too hard on the technology.

## Thoughts in class & on other presentations##

-These games can be used in museums as counter programming. This doesn't necessarily mean that you aren't working with the museum. It could mean that you're making extra special perks that visitors get to check out. 

-Art sabotage isn't my cup of tea, but making something that *adds* to the story, or tells a different version of the story that people have in their head isn't sabotage. The projection mapping will identify a new space on Albert street (specifically a vertical space) without destroying what already exists there. That new space will be the canvas on which I tell my "alternate" or "hidden" history. 

-Jen really likes this trees concept. City space isn't necessarily a building landscape... nature is just as much part of the city as well. 

## Projects that are going on in my head ##
**Aris Scavenger Hunt in Chicago**

-I've realized that the perks of a location based game is I can create a playable game across the world from me (or in Chicago) and someone can play it there, without me being there! As such, it's the perfect gift for someone broke to give! And that's me!

Here's the plan: 

-You can earn money in the form of hearts, kisses, hugs (affections)

-Use _affections_ to buy my valentines day gift

-needs photos, and to edit video letter

-Figure out how to test the game for a place that I'm not in.

-Figure out how to dowload the game on android

-/make both gifts

-/make "wink" icon

-make sure it's location accessible only once it's complete

-get android user to download aris and try it to make sure it works

**Art and History**

-A website where I can interact with my studies and my engagement of history through drawing.

-a way to encourage myself to produce more analog art, and keep the tactile in mind.

-a place to upload a CV, and use as a base for my professional internet presence.

-*Primary goal:* use the plan that I will make for the Ottawa Chinatown project as a post for this website.

## Concluding Thoughts ##

-I need to do research, so I know what sort historical project I will be able to create. Ideally, with research and reaching out to the community, I will be able to find more detailed information about some of the businesses and find a way to share that information. Extra photos and biographical information related to the families who owned those chosen businesses will be accessible on a website that will accompany the projection mapping event.

-Once I complete the research, then I can delve into the best way that I can portray it visually and digitally. I want to get my research done during reading week.
